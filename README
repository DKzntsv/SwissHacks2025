SwissHack 2025 Project for Julius Baer called onSync.
onSync is an AI-powered onboarding accelerator built for private banking.
It automates document analysis, detects data inconsistencies in real time, and highlights exactly where action is needed â€” allowing Relationship Managers to resolve issues in seconds, not hours. By cutting onboarding time by up to 90%, Onsynk unlocks faster revenue, improves client satisfaction, and turns compliance from a bottleneck into a competitive edge.
